Three NWchem output files are read in neutral.nwo, charge1.nwo, and
straight.nwo. Python file reads in the first two output files for the
neutral ground state and charge (+1) calculations and processces the
data. An error is calculated as J = |SCF-neutral - SCF-charge1 + IP|


Plots the error funtion that allows us to visualize the minimum
functional parameters. Calculation using the parameters that give
this minimum is done to test straight line behavior. Using
straight.nwo file, total DFT energy vs # of electrons are plotted to see
how straight the line.

The first plot for the error is done using GNUplot script (tmp.gp) and
the second test plot using python file. R^2 for the straight line is also
determined.

To run:  python3.5 func.py

Press ENTER after closing first plot to generate second plot.
